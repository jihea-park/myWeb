Not Sharing Your Articles? You‚Äôre Doing Medium Wrong. Here‚Äôs a Checklist.
For better or worse, properly sharing your medium article is just as important as writing good content. Here‚Äôs a checklist.
So, you‚Äôve finally done it. You‚Äôve written your next Medium article! The next day, you check your Medium stats. But, they look something like this‚Ä¶


There‚Äôs nothing wrong with writing to a small audience. But like many nascent Medium bloggers, you were hoping for a broader reach.

Unfortunately, blogging isn‚Äôt just about writing good content and a catchy title and hoping others will find your content. It‚Äôs equally about sharing your article to a targeted audience that will benefit from your piece.

I‚Äôve created the list below that outlines the various outlets I generally consider for distribution every time I write a new blog article. This list is not comprehensive, but hopefully serves as a great starting point.


Please remember: this blog post isn‚Äôt about how to spam your article to as many communities as possible. Always be respectful and intentional about how you share content. Is this something that will benefit the recipients? Would you mind if someone shared a similar article on your platforms?
1. Medium Publications
Of course, you‚Äôre a Medium blogger, so let‚Äôs start on the platform itself. Medium doesn‚Äôt give much capability for writers to boost their articles on the platform except for Medium Publications.

Medium Publications are the best way to get visibility on your articles within the Medium platform. Think of them like topic-based, editor-approved content communities.

Many Medium publications are open for anyone to contribute‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämost have sign-up forms for submitting content in their about pages (here‚Äôs an example for Hacker Noon). I‚Äôm a huge fan of what AMI Publications has done with Medium‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey own Hacker Noon as well as several other publications that distribute great community-created content.

Here‚Äôs a list of Medium Publications‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfind the relevant ones and check their ‚Äúabout‚Äù page to see how to submit. Or you can try sites Smedian.

2. Twitter
Twitter can be a confusing community for newcomers. In general, I always tweet when I write a new article. There are a few key edits to your tweets that can amplify your blog posts:

Hashtags. Make sure your post is hashtagged easily so others can find it. This works better for niche topics like #tostitos versus vague topics like #technology.
Mentions. Twitter is an awesome community because you can reach out to famous people. Heck, even Elon Musk responds to complete strangers! Use the ‚Äú@‚Äù symbol to tag relevant influencers on Twitter that might be interested in liking or retweeting your content.
Likes. Did you know Medium has an easy way to see every single tweet that mentions your article? Click ‚Äúreferrers‚Äù on your article‚Äôs stats page, and then click the ‚Äútwitter.com‚Äù title. This automatically links to a page that filters just for your article‚Äôs mentions. Go crazy and hit ‚Äúlike‚Äù for all those tweets!
3. Facebook
Of course, you can post every article to your news feed, but after a while your friends might be frustrated by spam. I personally only post articles to my Facebook profile if the content is relevant to my friends. Otherwise I individually message the article to those I think would benefit from the content.

Instead, focus on the Facebook Groups features. Find Facebook Groups relevant to your blogging topics. For example, if you blog about minimalism, just Facebook search for ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù and you‚Äôll see several local minimalist meet-up groups.

IMPORTANT: Facebook Groups, as many of these platforms I‚Äôll mention below, are communities. Think about it this way. You wouldn‚Äôt approach your friends, tell them all of your thoughts, and then leave without listening and participating in the conversation. In online communities, it‚Äôs important to be a contributor to the community. Please do not just use communities as places for you to spam your articles.
4. LinkedIn
In LinkedIn‚Äôs culture, it‚Äôs generally acceptable to post your articles frequently to your profile, as it is with Twitter. LinkedIn is especially great for topics related to your company or industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääadd this context to the posts you publish to personalize.

LinkedIn also has a very similar LinkedIn Groups feature, where you can join and post your articles to topic-based communities.

5. Reddit

Now you‚Äôre getting the hang of sharing your article and might be thinking, well, what about Reddit? Reddit is awesome because of the many topic-based subreddits, where your article can target a very specific set of users.

In reality, the Reddit community detests self-promotion. It makes sense. Without proper community guidelines, Reddit would just be a dump of useless links posted by marketers fighting for eyeballs on their content.

If you do choose to post on the few subreddits that allow self-promotion, carefully read the guidelines posted for each subreddit, be respectful, and actively participate in the community.

6. Other Online Communities
Of course, for each topic, there are sometimes unique community platforms. A short list of some major others includes Slack, Hacker News, Metafilter, Digg, and Google Plus. Each platform has its own set of topics, rules, and interaction models.

7. Press
Usually, Medium blog articles don‚Äôt get covered in the press. However, I‚Äôve had a few of my articles get reposted into the press, especially when I do something particularly newsworthy. My most popular HQ Trivia hacking article was featured in Time, The Verge, NY Mag, and many others. My other news-published articles include my Lyft tip analysis article, which was republished in CityLab, and my Clipper Card wearable hack, which was featured in SFGate.

You can try to tip your favorite press sites (e.g. Mashable), but I‚Äôve found that press sites will usually find out about your article on their own (especially if you spread it out via the above methods).

8. Organization/Influencer Reach-out

Yep, this is real. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/880240049677357057?lang=en
Sometimes, your blog post might be of interest to a VIP or organization. Perhaps you‚Äôve written about some gifts that minimalists could buy, and one of the gifts is sold by a company with a large following. Or maybe you‚Äôve done an interview with a professor at a local university, and the university‚Äôs twitter page would want to retweet.

In many cases, your blog article will mention entities that have private email distributions or public social media followings. Send a well-worded cold email to ask if the organization or individual is interested in reading your article or sharing to their communities. Who knows, they might love it and share to the press!

9. Email Newsletter
As you continue to blog, it‚Äôs also very beneficial to build out an email newsletter. Not everyone logs into Medium; email is still the best way to reach people. These subscribers are your dedicated fans.

Logistically speaking, I use Upscribe for the easy Medium integration. I send a monthly newsletter to my subscribers that recaps the articles I‚Äôve posted that month. If you‚Äôre curious to see what I send out, subscribe in the footer below.

10. The Footer
And lastly, the most important part of a Medium article‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe footer. At the end of each article is an opportunity to request an action from the user. If they enjoyed your article, they can clap it, share it, tweet it, subscribe to your blog, etc.

At the footer, it‚Äôs also a great opportunity to link to more of your great content. I typically link to three other related Medium posts. In fact, the 6th highest source of traffic to my articles are from links in my other articles!

Need an example of a good footer? Check out the one below. üòâ
